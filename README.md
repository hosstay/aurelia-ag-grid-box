# agGrid Spreadsheet

A personal utility for componentizing a box with an ag-grid in it via aurelia.

Caution: There's a good amount of small bugs and css issues from when I extracted this from another project, but the framework is good.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Must have installed agGrid into your project (TODO: Get html script version to work so no packages needed)

npm install ag-grid-community

npm install ag-grid-enterprise

Must be using Aurelia framework for the compose tag componentization. Could replace that with something else easily.

### Installing

* Have agGrid installed into project
* Have Aurelia installed as your framework.
* Copy the gridbox folder to your frontend.
  (Does rely on Dataloader for now, which is just my method of getting data from the backend. Can rewrite it how you want it.)
* TODO: figure out how to make an npm installer.

## Built With

* [agGrid](https://www.ag-grid.com/) - Grid
* [Aurelia](https://aurelia.io/) - Framework, Componentization
